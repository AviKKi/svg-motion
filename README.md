## Features

- BYOK you can use your own OpenRouter Key with this

<br />

## Getting Started

Run locally to explore and develop.

### Pre-requisite

- Node.js 18+ (or 20+ recommended)
- pnpm, npm, or yarn

### Starting Development server

- Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
# or
yarn
```

- Start the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start a Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Build and Preview

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm preview
# or
npm run build && npm run preview
```

The preview server also runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

### Notes

- A sample SVG (`public/sampleSvg/phone-call.svg`) and a pre-wired test animation are included so you can see the timeline and preview working immediately on first run.
- The renderer is loaded inside an iframe from `public/svg-renderer.html` and communicates with the editor via `postMessage`.
